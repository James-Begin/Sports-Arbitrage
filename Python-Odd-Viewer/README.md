This simple python program outputs head to head odds for upcoming sports.
Currently only supports American MLB, NBA, NHL, and NFL but can be easily modified to support more regions and game types.

All the data is from [The Odds Api](https://the-odds-api.com/) and offer very easy and intuitive way to get sports data for free.
The API key provided is free and allows for 500 API calls per month. Anyone can acquire one, only an email is needed. The Odds Api also offers very detailed documentation and code examples that I used to create this tool.

Overall, this was just one part of the entire sports-arbitrage project.
