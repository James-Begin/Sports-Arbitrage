# Sports-Sure-Bet-Calculator

This simple calculator allows the user to enter 2 or 3 odds in both American and Decimal formats. The calculator then determines whether a Sure Bet (Arbitrage bet) is possible. Either way, the potential profit or loss is returned.

The formula for a surebet is 1/oddA + 1/oddB + ... < 1
This essentially finds the sum of the cost to earn 1 dollar. For example, if an odd is 2.6, you earn $2.6 for every $1 bet or it costs $0.38 to earn $1.
If the total cost to bet on all sides is less than 1 to earn 1 dollar, there is an opportunity for riskless profit.
